Serverless - the hype, the craze, and everything in between. Yet, there are many issues. Serverless is both smooth,
and clunky. Connecting workflows is difficult and weird, so weird that AWS makes money off of Step Functions
where you are able to better orchestrate these varying work loads. My idea here is to try to create a declaritive
based language that can define these workflows, for free. Similar to how terraform solved the major issue of 
infrastructure as code, this would solve the issue of serverless orchestration as code. Things like adding in failover,
async circuit breakers, and most impossibly, any sort of state, could potentially be resolved through the abstraction
of such a thing.
