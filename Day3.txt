GitLab Duo:

With my team adopting more gitlab duo usage, i wanted to dive into it and see the pros and cons of utilizing this tool,
and sort of get a feel as to where I can count on it.

Some of the features for enterprise includes deployment flexibility as well as allowing teams to utilize AI in deployment
and innovation without sacrificing control over sensitive data, IP, etc. -- a pattern I've noticed in recent AI adoption 
(e.c. amazon Q, copilot, etc.). 

Gitlab Duo seems to have an aim to break past the security concerns that have been a barrier for AI adoption. I'm curious
on future vulnerabilities to arise from exploiting said AI adoption. Could be a good research point in the future. 

Gitlab Duo provides an LLM selection with deployment options, as well as granular control over data locality for residency
regulations. We are also able to see full request and response logs. 

Lambda cost efficiency:

Did some further research into lambdas, diving into Graviton arm64 for a lower cost and better price-performance;

(Self note - ask team about this)

Analyze potential migration dependencies within our infrastructure and CI/CD. Analyze lambdas with AWS Compute Optimizer
for memory size recommendations from production telemetry, and scale to reduce duration costs? We also can dive into AWS 
Lambda Power Tuning state machine to empirically benchmark our cost vs latency across memory sizes, picking our optimal 
power setting.
