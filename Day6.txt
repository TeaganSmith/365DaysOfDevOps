DevOps - the differnece between DevOps in big-tech versus consuming companies.

Something that has been interesting me lately, and something I'd like to expand on in the future, is the difference in DevOps
workflows in big tech versus consuming companies like Southwest. At a base level, consuming company devops and cloud work is a
lot more focused on using existing infra and understandings to increase efficiency at decreased costs and time. For example, 
building a platform for infrastructure provisioning with improved CI/CD pipelines, makefiles to set up deployment environments 
more efficiently, and expanding knowledge in tools like terraform, gitlab / jenkins, and cloud providers. You are essentially 
aiming to utilize and assemble existing components and managing their configurations rather than building infrastructure primitives. 

DevOps at a big tech company appears to involve much more platform-engineering esque workflows. Building internal tools to abstract
infrastructure complexities, and being able to build and utilize specialized internal systems. However, these typically are only
relevant at an extreme scale. Most companies seem to lack the engineering resources to maintain custom infrastructure, or the revenue /
type of user base to even justify it in the first place. (Big tech needs customers after all).
