This is less of a blog, and utilized today to read up on this weeks news. A lot of AI hype, random stuff going on.
Not really sure how to write about this. Companies like Nvidia are using ai at a scary rate, borderline unsustainable in my opinion.
Quantum chips and quantum computing seem to be getting stronger and stronger. Tech expansions are reaching the UAE / Saudi Arabia.
Various bitcoin and crypto mining projects are migrating to ai infrastructure. As AI progresses, I foresee large power issues in
the near future. Energy is definitely going to get more and more expensive, and there will need to be breakthroughs in energy usage 
and /or development to keep up this rate. Neurotech is progressing at a rapid rate. New depression drugs / medications are being 
funded at Alto Neuroscience. I'm extremely concern on the coming months / years of AI development. It is very clearly in a boom or
bust point, where we will either reach highs that will set the new low, or we will have a worldwide 'dot com' burst once revenues
are proven to not keep up with the investment and hype of these ai technologies. On a more positive note, google maps is able to power
ai apps through the Gemini API much more efficiently. Snowflake and Palantir are partnering to integrate AI applications with their
data platforms -- oh lord.
